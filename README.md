"That's what Xi Said" is an ongoing textual analysis project of the public speeches of President Xi Jinping, the current head of state for the People's Republic of China. The project contains a convienient text corpus of Xi's public speeches from 2022-2025. 

Using this text corpus, I train a relatively simple k-th order Markov model that allows for probabilistic speaker attribution. While I have primarily adopted my Markov model algorithm from a previous project/assignment I wrote [^1], I am excited to see if these NLP techniques previously trained on an English language corpus will be salient for a Mandarin Chinese corpus.
