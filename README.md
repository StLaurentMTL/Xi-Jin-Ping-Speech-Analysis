# 习近平重要讲话计算文本分析

This serves as a proof of concept whereby I scrape and conduct textual analysis from a collection of recent speeches from President Xi Jinping, the current head of state for the People's Republic of China

This project will be unique in the sense that the textual analysis will be from the native Mandarin Chinese. Although I am able to read the text myself, this will be an opportunity whereby I will learn how to conduct computational text analysis for a language that is, in many respects, fundamentally different from English.
